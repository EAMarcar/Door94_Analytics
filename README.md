There are two utlities - Power BI reports not intended for end use.  The first is the Analyticis Dayas Model that houses the model used by the Partner and Sponsor reports.  The second is the Community Data SSet Generator which extracts data from the data model to create an aggregated data set for public distribution.

There are 5 reports: Sponsor Analytics and Partner/School Analytics.  Each of this has a protrait version used to format images for email distribution. The fifth report is a Community Report that displays aggregated data intended for public consumption.
